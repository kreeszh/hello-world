Creating a hello world repo to learn how to use github


# Kreeszh

I have decided to delve back into web-development after a 20-year hiatus based on some of the challenges (and opportunities) at work.

In the short term, I will be able to leverage these skill to design web applications that can support the way we do work in the laboratory and at the hospital.

In the longer term, perhaps I will have additional opportunities available to me outside of the laboratory.

- Learn how to use git / github / gitlab (*with a specific focus on how to host a plain text, handcoded webpage*).
- Integrate my existing Google Workspace web applications with a publicly hosted page.
- Begin to learn statically-generated pages (e.g., Jekyll).
- Delve into deeper levels of automation.
